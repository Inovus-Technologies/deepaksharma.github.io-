    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a self-driven developer with a strong interest in programming,
        computer science fundamentals, and system-level design.
        My work emphasizes logic-first solutions, explainability,
        and scalable thinking over quick fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
        I actively integrate Artificial Intelligence into my workflow
        to analyze problems, evaluate multiple approaches,
        and refine solutions before implementation.
        This allows me to deliver thoughtful and future-ready results.

<section class="experience">
    <h2>Experience & Approach</h2>
    <p>
        My experience is built through continuous hands-on learning,
        experimentation, and deep exploration of how systems work internally.
        I focus on understanding fundamentals rather than relying blindly on tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach enables me to adapt quickly,
        reason clearly about new problems,
        and design solutions that remain understandable and extensible.
